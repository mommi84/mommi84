## Hi, I'm Tom! 👋

🎡 I'm a London-based AI enthusiast with the dream of giving my small contribution to the quest for intelligence, bridging the gap between **language models** and **symbolic systems**.

🎓 I obtained my **Bachelor of Engineering** from Polytechnic of Milan and my **Master of Science in AI** from University of Milan-Bicocca. I also completed my **PhD** studies at Leipzig University, where I authored 10+ first-author publications in the fields of **machine learning**, **knowledge graphs**, and **question answering**.

🔬 I'm currently working on **AI-driven strategic foresight**, a novel intersectional field where language models are leveraged to forecast future events for strategic decision making. You can read [a pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04880v1) of our most recent work which will appear in the proceedings of IEEE ICSC 2025.

🥁 My personal interests include **genealogy** (building a genealogist agent), **progressive music** (published 3 albums [as a drummer](http://tommaso-soru.it/music) and a solo AI album), and **quantitative finance** (experimented with [trading strategies](https://github.com/mommi84/hypeminer)).

🤖 My AI research timeline:
- **2007**: Did B.Eng. thesis at the Artificial Intelligence & Robotics Lab, PoliMi
- **2010**: Built my first swarm of intelligent agents
- **2012**: Published my M.Sc. work on active learning for entity resolution
- **2016**: Started researching neuro-symbolic methods
- **2017**: Published [Neural SPARQL Machines](github.com/LiberAI/NSpM), most cited research poster ever of the Semantics conference
- **2018**: Implemented a generative AI model for the first time
- **Mar 2023**: Built an [LLM agent](https://github.com/mommi84/gpt-does-stuff/) from scratch before LLM agents were a thing
- **Sep 2024**: Achieved 1,000 citations in [Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=9aI21r8AAAAJ)
- **Jan 2025**: Built an [AI-driven system](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icsc/2025/242600a226/27FQF0bZore) to forecast future events
